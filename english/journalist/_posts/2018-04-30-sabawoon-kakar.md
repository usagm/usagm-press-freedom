Sabawoon Kakar was killed on April 30, 2018, as a result of two coordinated suicide bombings in Kabul, Afghanistan. Kakar was one of the first journalists to arrive at the scene of the first explosion, where a suicide bomber on a motorcycle blew himself up in the Shash Darak area. The second blast came at the hands of a bomber posing as a cameraman, gathering near several other journalists who were reporting on the tragedy. Kakar was rushed to hospital, where he ultimately succumbed to his injuries several hours later.

Kakar was a key member of Radio Free Afghanistan’s video team. His work included feature stories about social issues in Afghanistan — such as the [status of women’s cricket](https://pa.azadiradio.com/a/29194105.html) in the country — as well as news about counterterrorism operations and security issues.

Kakar’s [last video report](https://pa.azadiradio.com/a/29198801.html) on April 29 was a package he produced with RFE/RL reporters in the northern Afghan province of Baghlan about a battle between Afghan security forces and Taliban militants.

On his Facebook page, Kakar declared that despite bombing attacks against voter registration centers in Kabul, he had registered and planned to vote in Afghanistan’s October 20 parliamentary elections.

The 30-year-old Kakar, a native of Kabul, died one day before his fifth anniversary as an RFE/RL journalist.

He is survived by his wife and a two-year-old son.
