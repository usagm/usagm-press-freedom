Mohammed Ali Nuxurkey, a VOA reporter in Somalia, was killed March 19, 2013, after a bomb exploded near the National Theater in Mogadishu. He was 29 years old.

The explosion killed 11 people and injured around 20 others; Nuxurkey died of his injuries at Madina Hospital several hours later. According to reports, a suicide bomber was targeting the cityâ€™s security chief and several other intelligence officers.

Nuxurkey had been contributing to VOA for the several months, gathering material for breaking news stories, including past bomb attacks in the Somali capital, and the controversial trial of a woman who said she had been raped by Somali forces. Nuxurkey also worked with several independent local radio stations and associations, including Radio Mustaqbal, Radio Kulmiye and as a presenter for Horn Afrik TV and Radio.

He was survived by a wife and young baby.
