On April 30, 2018, Maharram Durrani was on her way to a training session at RFE/RL’s Kabul bureau when a coordinated suicide attack killed 25 people. She was among the nine journalists who died that morning in Afghanistan’s capital.

Before accepting a position with RFE/RL, Durrani worked for an Afghan online music channel called Radio Salam Watandar. She was a third-year student of Islamic law at Kabul University and just beginning her career in journalism.

May 15 would have been her first with RFE/RL’s Radio Azadi working on a weekly women’s program.

“When I began working in media, one of my first bosses asked me why I was studying Islamic law but working in media,” Durrani told RFE/RL during a February phone-in program. “He said these are not related subjects. But I said, ‘No, that’s not true’,” she explained. “It’s very much related because the media can provide information to all people.”

Durrani was 28-year old.
