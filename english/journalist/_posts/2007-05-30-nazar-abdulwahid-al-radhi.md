Nazar Abdulwahid Al-Radhi, a correspondent for RFE/RL’s Radio Free Iraq (RFI), was shot and killed in the southern city of Al-Amarah on May 30, 2007. He was 37.

Al-Radhi was targeted as he was exiting a hotel after a journalism workshop he had just covered for RFI.

He had been threatened previously because of his work for a “foreign agency” and his uncompromising stand against extremism.

Al-Radhi is survived by his mother, wife and four children (ages 9, 7, 5 and 2 at the time of his death).
