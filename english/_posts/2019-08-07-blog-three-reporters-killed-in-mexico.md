Three reporters were killed in Mexico in just the past week, again raising warnings from press advocacy groups about hazardous conditions in the Latin American nation.

They raise the total number of journalists killed to eight so far in 2019 and cement Mexico’s reputation as one of the deadliest places to practice journalism. 

The deaths occurred in three different states, and authorities say initially they do not appear linked. But journalists – especially those covering the drug trade – have long been under threat by criminal cartels. 

On July 30, Rogelio Barra was found dead from a gun blast in Morelos state. Three days later reporter Edgar Alberto Nava was shot and killed in neighboring Guerrero state. On the same day, Jorge Celestino Ruiz was shot in Veracruz state, on the eastern Atlantic seaboard. 

The Mexico City-based El Universal newspaper reports that police say Ruiz was murdered in the evening at the small tienda that he owned and operated. The magazine Proceso says Ruiz was a reporter for the El Grafico newspaper, where he covered crime and violence, among other issues. 

The website La Silla Rota (“The Broken Chair”) reports that Ruiz had been assaulted twice before, as well as being threatened by local mayor Paulino Dominguez. Mayor Dominguez declined to comment, the website reports.   

The Guardian newspaper reports that Cuitlahuac Garcia, governor of Veracruz state, said on Twitter: “We condemn the cowardly murder of a reporter from a local outlet, Jorge Ruiz. His killing will not go unpunished.”

However, the journalism advocacy group the Committee to Protect Journalists said officials at all levels of government aren’t doing enough to investigate the rash of killings, including Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador. 

“Mexican authorities must do everything in their power to ensure that Jorge Celestino Ruiz Vázquez’s death does not become another murder statistic,” CPJ’s Jan-Albert Hootsen said in a statement. “This past week must be a catalyst for a comprehensive plan to stamp out impunity.”

The group Reporters Without Borders ranks Mexico 144th out of 180 countries in terms of press freedom, due a climate of “constant fear and violence.”
