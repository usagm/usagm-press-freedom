The standoff in Venezuela between the government of Nicholas Maduro and political adversary Juan Guaido is hardening, with the prospect of violence a threat not only for citizens but for reporters covering the crisis. Maduro has long targeted press freedom, with calls to “media warfare” and rising censorship. 

Over the last four years, Venezuela slipped 32 places on the World Press Freedom Index, resting near the bottom at 148th out of 180 countries. But journalists have more to contend with than repression; their country is falling apart, with shortages of food, water, and electricity. VOA went to Caracas to profile three media organizations and the struggles their journalists endure.
