Mexico is burnishing its reputation as one of the deadliest places to be a journalist. Five reporters have been killed so far this year – most recently Francisco Romero Díaz in the city of Playa del Carmen.

The city, a beachside resort on the scenic Yucatan peninsula, has witnessed an uptick in the number of locals and tourists killed. Most of the attacks have been linked to rival Sinaloa and Zetas drug cartels.

Although it’s unclear exactly why Romero Díaz was targeted, he’d been under federal protection since 2018 and had received past death threats thanks to his work covering courts and crime. In 2012, the Mexican government approved the Protection of Human Rights Defenders and Journalists Act. However, the law has often been underfunded, and since 2012, the Committee to Protect Journalists reports that 222 Mexican reporters have been killed because of their work.

Authorities say Romero Díaz left his house May 16 without informing his government bodyguards. The Committee to Protect Journalists, quoting his wife and his editor, said he was pursuing a story tip. The authorities said Romero Díaz encountered gunmen who shot him in the head.

Despite some moves to protect journalists, many of these killings in Mexico go unpunished. According to the advocacy organization Reporters Without Borders, “Collusion between officials and organized crime poses a grave threat to journalists’ safety and cripples the judicial system at all levels.”

In CPJ’s report on the killing, the group’s Mexico representative Jan-Albert Hootsen said "authorities must do everything in their power to bring the culprits to justice, and the Federal Protection Mechanism must conduct a thorough review into the murder of a journalist under its protection program."

Romero Díaz was 28 and had been reporting for the local paper [Quintana Roo Hoy](quintanaroohoy.com/). He previously reported for a site on Facebook, [Semanario Playa News](https://www.facebook.com/Semanario-playa-News-327931544510576/). The page’s founder and a colleague were killed in July 2018, according to CPJ.
