Azory Gwanda, an independent journalist working in Tanzania, was last seen by his wife Anna Pinoni. He arrived at their farmstead in a car that was not his, asked for the house keys, and reportedly said he was taking an emergency trip. The [Inter-Press News Service in Africa reports](http://www.ipsnews.net/2019/05/world-press-freedom-day-let-us-ask-whereisazory/) that Pinoni later returned to their home, only to discover it had been ransacked. That was November 21, 2017; Gwanda has not been seen or heard from since.

The 42-year-old Gwanda had been writing for two newspapers, “Mwananchi” and “The Citizen.”  His latest work had focused on reporting about a series of killings in Tanzania’s Coast region, in the east along the Indian Ocean when he suddenly went missing. Speaking with editors of “Mwananchi”, [Pinoni said she knew very little](https://www.mwananchi.co.tz/habari/Anna-asema-huenda-habari-za-mauaji-ndizo-zilizimpoteza-mumewe/1597578-4216010-118l7gl/index.html) about what happened, or why her husband disappeared, but speculated it might have something to do with his recent reporting work.

Agence France-Press has reported that Gwanda was focusing on killings in the Kibiti district, where 39 people – mainly police officers – had been killed over a two-year period. The government had grown concerned and even suggested that arrests of the killer or killers were imminent. But none ever came, and Gwanda remained missing.

While police have said they are investigating Gwanda’s disappearance and want to hear from the public, in January 2018 the Tanzanian Home Affairs minister, Mwigulu Nchemba, [said that](https://www.thecitizen.co.tz/News/1840340-4546834-26ttpaz/index.html) if people don’t have information to relate to the police they should “shut up” about Gwanda.

Since 2017 at least five newspapers have been banned in Tanzania.
